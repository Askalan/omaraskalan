    <p><h1 class="post">THE HISTORY OF SOMALI AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 1970-1980.</h1>
      “Most of Somali young agricultural engineers are interested to be agronomist”

      Why Agronomy?
      
      Somalia is the world's largest frankincense producer.
      
      Historical background of agricultural production practices in Somalia Cultivated crops into Somalia go back, probably in colonial times. There is Strong belief that Italians, Arabs, and Indians introduced crops in Somalia for their daily needs and to a lesser extent for their daily income purposes. Agricultural production practices and crop handling grew among the Somalis after 1960. Agriculture is the most significant sector of the economy, accounting for four times the value of agricultural production and earning almost three-fifths of Somalia's international transactions. In Somalia, agriculture is categorized into three subsectors.
      <details class="departments">
        <summary>More
        </summary>
         
      1.     the nomadic pastoralism is first one, which occurs outside of agricultural regions. This sector, which focuses on; goats, sheep, camels, and cattle, and it has grown more market oriented.
      
      2.     The second sector is the traditional farming system, chiefly subsistence, agriculture practiced by small farmers and limited areas. This traditional sector is divided into two types farming systems:
      
      a.      Rain-fed farming in the south and northwest that grows sorghum, usually with a huge livestock herd. If these farmers get government support can product these products: butter, cheese, cream, yogurt, ghee, condensed milk, dried milk, ice cream, etc. and produces various by-products including buttermilk, whey, ghee, and skim milk. Unfortunately, they can only depend on animals’ exportation, to maintain their daily life. 
      
      b.     Small, irrigated farms that plant crops; maize, sesame, cowpeas, vegetables, and fruits. These farmers are not near rivers, but they can irrigate crops by taking water from long distance rivers or near lakes, also well that is 10-30 m depth. These farmers still have faith to support the people lost their resource due to drought that occurs continuously in the country.
      
      3.     The third sector consists of medium-scale market-oriented farming and large-scale irrigated land along the lower Jubba and Shabelle rivers. There are the major crops: bananas, sugarcane, rice, cotton, vegetables, grapefruit, mangoes, and papayas.
      
      The acacia species of southern Somalia's thorny savanna provide fine timber and are the main source of charcoal, although charcoal output has long beyond environmentally permissible limits. More efficient and cautious management of frankincense, myrrh, and other resin-producing plants may boost aromatic gum production. In the north, the country's minor fishing industry centers around the catch and canning of tunny (tuna) and mackerel. Sharks are frequently captured and dried by artisanal inshore fishermen. Choice fish and shellfish are prepared for export in southern Somalia. Climate change, overfishing, and increased piracy along Somalia's coasts harmed the country's fishing economy in the early twenty-first century.
      
      The main reason is the government of Somali strongly needed agronomics more than other specialization of one department between 1960-1990 YEARS, because the country’s production was very low, according to other countries. To get specialize area persons the government had project was called (the agricultural Crash program) and the project had various reasons. First aim was to take unemployed young persons from urban areas to special farms, give train them in skills associated agriculture, to take up farming system to increase production of the country, and make them special more employable in urban of all agricultural sectors. The program may not be much more. After Somali government was collapsed, the students did not get all departments of agriculture due to universities did not establish agriculture departments. all universities focus on other faculties. Education had become general, and most universities are private university. Because of job opportunities. As we know the only career that most of the agriculture graduates qualified is teaching. And almost all universities in the country don't have specialized agriculture departments. They teach general agriculture, so agronomy is the only department applicable to the opportunity. Agronomy is the most important field for producing quality with highly maximum yield. Practicing Good Agricultural Methods could be produced both of quality and yield improved production as well as industrially crop managed and improved production. In the agronomy all branches of Agriculture, Thus, agronomy as a branch of agricultural sciences deals with principles and practices of field management to produce field crops. Classification of field crops is necessary to know the adaptation, habitat, life cycle, nutrient requirement, insect-pest, disease reaction of crops, and the Crops water managements so that an appropriate production technology could be developed and adopted for maximum productivity at minimum when the student graduated from university, he/she can do all jobs related to agriculture field. But when he/she specialist one department they can only do what they specialized in, and in Somali it is difficult to get specialize job.

      Soil and Water
      Variety of Soil Types: There is soil fertility decline in most of potential agricultural areas. slightly acid or neutral Low Salinity in Soil and Irrigation Water Remarkable Results of Soil Analysis, Soil Ph≥ 8.5, Little bit High salinity in some cases little bit High in calcium Low Phosphorous Very Low Nitrogen Seasons in Somalia. The interfluvial limestone plateaus contain fertile dark gray to brown calcareous residual soils that are ideal for rain-fed agriculture. The richest soils are located in the Jubba and Shabeelle rivers' alluvial plains. These deep vertisols are coated with "black cotton soils," which are generated from disintegrated lava rocks (because cotton often is grown in them). These soils have a high potential for water retention and are mostly utilized for irrigation agriculture. About 30% of Somalia's land is degraded. It is critical to implement proper measures because 30% of Somalia's land is degraded. In response to continuous deterioration, it is essential to employ suitable sustainable soil / land management strategies. Here are soil from some somali regional that is good for agricultural productivity: the most productive soils are the following;
      
      1.     Black soil color is the first one that is good for crop productivity. İt can be found from Jowhar and middel shabelle regions.
      
      2.     Brown soil color is the secondry this is good crop production. You can found from Afgoia, Low. Shabelle regions
      
      3.     Dark brown Soil color is thirty and this can be found from Bal’ad Middle Shabelle
      
      There are four seasons in Somalia including: The Gu or main rainy season, lasts from April to June; the second rainy season, called the dayr extends from October to December and each is followed by a dry season, the main one (jilaal) from January to march and the second (xagaa) from July to September.
      The conflict's impact on agriculture production activities
      
        Trends in displacement and migration
      
        Untimely distribution of food aid
      
        Banana export markets have been lost.
      
        a scarcity of agricultural support services

            1.     Black soil color is the first one that is good for crop productivity. İt can be found from Jowhar and middel shabelle regions.
            
            2.     Brown soil color is the secondry this is good crop production. You can found from Afgoia, Low. Shabelle regions
            
            3.     Dark brown Soil color is thirty and this can be found from Bal’ad Middle Shabelle
            
            There are four seasons in Somalia including: The Gu or main rainy season, lasts from April to June; the second rainy season, called the dayr extends from October to December and each is followed by a dry season, the main one (jilaal) from January to march and the second (xagaa) from July to September.

              Soil and Water
              Variety of Soil Types: There is soil fertility decline in most of potential agricultural areas. slightly acid or neutral Low Salinity in Soil and Irrigation Water Remarkable Results of Soil Analysis, Soil Ph≥ 8.5, Little bit High salinity in some cases little bit High in calcium Low Phosphorous Very Low Nitrogen Seasons in Somalia. The interfluvial limestone plateaus contain fertile dark gray to brown calcareous residual soils that are ideal for rain-fed agriculture. The richest soils are located in the Jubba and Shabeelle rivers' alluvial plains. These deep vertisols are coated with "black cotton soils," which are generated from disintegrated lava rocks (because cotton often is grown in them). These soils have a high potential for water retention and are mostly utilized for irrigation agriculture. About 30% of Somalia's land is degraded. It is critical to implement proper measures because 30% of Somalia's land is degraded. In response to continuous deterioration, it is essential to employ suitable sustainable soil / land management strategies.
