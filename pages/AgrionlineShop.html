      <p>Keep an eye out for an email from me once you complete this course.  In the email I will include a link to the "Secret Lecture" 
        I taped for you.  In this lecture I break some of my own rules of coding and show you simple (but not best-practice) tips on styling your 
        final project to make it more attractive.  So if you haven't finished the final project, 
        how can you possibly procrastinate now that you know there is a secret lecture???</p> -->
